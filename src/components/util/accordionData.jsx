  //     <ul>
  //       <li className="bold">Find item</li>
  //       <p>The " Find item" field is a keyword search. It matches the titles of swaps on Kapitify. Choose your keywords carefully. If all of the words you type in are not in the title, the item won’t appear in your search results.</p>
  //       <li className="bold">Location</li>
  //       <p>This is a functionality that helps limit your search results to a specific region. You will see a drop-down list of states options. You are to type in your city. If you don’t see your area appear, try an area nearby.</p>

  //     <p>Filters allow you to limit your searches to swaps with a specific attribute. This functionality can be accessed by tapping on the Sort section. The basic filters are:</p>
  //     <ol>
  //       <li>The item you wish to swap for</li>
  //       <li>Item swaps and open to offers swaps</li>
  //       <li>The category of the items </li>

    title: 'How do I add Photos?',
    content: <div className="faq-item">
      <p>Adding Photos</p>
      <p>Photos are the first part of an ad that most swappers see. Adding clear, detailed pictures draws swappers into your ad and saves you time answering questions that could be answered with a photo. Kapitify allows up to 6 images on each ad. Don’t be afraid to use them all.</p>
      <p>Tips when taking photos:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        Use bright lighting and uncluttered background.
        </li>
        <li>
        Take photos of your item from different angles so buyers can get a 360 degree look.
        </li>
        <li>The larger the item you’re selling, the more photos you should take.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To add photos:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        If you’re posting a new ad, tap "Post an Ad" or the addition symbol in your profile page.
        </li>
        <li>
        Click "Add Image" to choose photos from your file browser, to add more than one photo hold and tap multiple photos at the same time.
        </li>
      </ul>
        <p>Always remember, you cannot edit an ad once uploaded </p>
       <p>Please note that Kaptify will automatically delete all images from ads that have been inactive for 6 months or more.</p>

    content: <div className="faq-item">
      <p> It is a digital platform that allows physical assets to be recorded and exchanged with ease, enabling users to exchange items without the use of any currency.</p>
      <p>Digital bartering platforms allow physical assets to be recorded and exchanged with ease, bringing barter-based transactions into today's context. Like an e-commerce platform, users upload the items they have to offer. People can then offer their items in exchange, organized by proximity if necessary. Like ridesharing or home rental apps, security features are offered to keep track of transactions, swappers' identities, protecting its users from possible scams and fraud-like circumstances.</p>
      <p>This platform can reduce bureaucracy, add liquidity to the global marketplace, and fundamentally reduce the need for intermediaries across worldwide trading systems. However, to work at scale, a standard measure of value must be established among all parties.</p>

      <p>You can always discuss with the swapper a comfortable way of delivering, but at your own risk.</p>
