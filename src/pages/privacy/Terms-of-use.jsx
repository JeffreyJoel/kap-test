                    our posting rules, are breached, either directly or indirectly. In case you would have paid a fee for the
                    display of such ad, you may be entitled to a refund of such fee. However, we reserve the right not to
                    refund Kapitify users for any fees paid through use of Kapitify in the following cases:</p>

                    report any advertisement which may infringe on their rights, and submit a request for such
                    advertisement to be removed. If a legal representative of the entitled party reports this to us in the
                    correct manner, the product infringing on intellectual property rights will be removed by Kapitify.
