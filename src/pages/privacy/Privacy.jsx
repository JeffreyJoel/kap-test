                <p className='Content'>Personal information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.

                    We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination
                    with other information or otherwise. We collect personal information from you when you use our services.
